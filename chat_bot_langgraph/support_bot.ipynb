      "What exactly does the ID scan check and where does this take place?\n",
      "The ID scan and comparison with a selfie prevents fraud and ensures that the person who booked the flight is the actual invoice recipient and that there has been no identity theft. For this purpose, you will receive a link via text message to your smartphone. You will be able to upload your documents and identify yourself via this link.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do I have to carry out the ID scan for every booking?\n",
      "No, once you have successfully completed the ID scan, you will not have to do it again for a later booking.\n",

      "Can I repeat a failed ID scan?\n",
      "Yes, if your documents were not recognised, you may repeat the ID scan.\n",
      "\n",
      "What reasons could there be for not authorising the \"Pay per invoice\" option?\n",
      "For \"Pay per invoice\", our partner POWERPAY carries out an online check. This check may have a negative outcome for a variety of reasons, such as creditworthiness, contradictory information or unpaid POWERPAY invoices. You can find more detailed information about these reasons on the ​POWERPAY website.\n",
      "\n",
      "How and when will I receive the POWERPAY invoice?\n",
      "Invoices are issued by POWERPAY. You will receive an individual invoice by e-mail after about 24–48 hours. This invoice is issued free of charge. When the individual invoice is paid on time, no charges are incurred. After this, the amounts outstanding from the individual invoices you have already received will be summarised into one account statement. You will receive this statement by post in the form of a monthly invoice approximately in the middle of the following month, together with a paying-in slip. The cost for issuing the monthly invoice is CHF 2.90.\n",
      "\n",
      "How long is the payment period and how much are the reminder fees for non-payment?\n",
      "Individual invoice: The invoice must be paid within 15 days of receipt of the e-mail. Payment will be processed via online banking. Payments made at the post office counter incur third-party costs.\n",
      "Monthly invoice: The deadline for payment is always the end of the month with the paying-in slip.\n",
      "Is partial payment possible?\n",
      "Yes, partial payment is possible for both the individual and the monthly invoices. You can decide to pay between 10% and 100% of the total amount due.\n",
      "\n",
      "When does a reminder fee become due and how much does it cost?\n",
      "If the minimum payment of the monthly invoice is made late, POWERPAY charges a reminder fee of CHF 15 for the first reminder and CHF 25 for the second reminder.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do I get a refund if I cancel my ticket?\n",
      "This depends on when you make the cancellation.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the invoice has already been paid, you will receive the corresponding refund by bank transfer.\n",
      "If SWISS is able to inform POWERPAY of the cancellation before the end of the payment period and if the invoice has not been paid or has only been partially paid, POWERPAY will send you a new individual invoice with the new amount and the new payment period if there is still an amount pending.\n",
      "If SWISS is only able to inform POWERPAY once the end of the payment period has been reached, and if the invoice has not been paid or only partially paid, the MF Group will send you a monthly invoice with the additional costs of CHF 2.90 minus the amount to be refunded.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Do I have to pay the invoice in full before boarding my flight?\n",
      "No, you can board your flight regardless of whether you have paid your POWERPAY invoice or not.\n",

      "\n",
      "You decide which currency is to be charged to your credit card.\n",
      "The daily exchange rate is displayed, and is guaranteed for the payment.\n",
      "Credit card companies usually charge an additional fee for purchases in foreign currencies (foreign currency fee). This does not apply if you pay in the currency of your credit card.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Who can benefit from the currency conversion option?\n",
      "The option to pay in a different currency is available only when booking through swiss.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service cannot be used to change flights, for later upgrades or additional services (e.g. additional baggage item etc.) or for ticket purchases made through different booking channels. These are charged in the original currency of the departure airport.\n",
      "\n",
      "What exchange rate is used for the conversion?\n",
      "The total converted amount is based on the daily exchange rates of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). Please note that the exchange range can therefore vary for new bookings or booking enquiries made through swiss.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "The exchange rate at the time the booking is concluded is definitive. It will appear both on swiss.com and on the confirmation.\n",

      "The fares Economy Classic, Economy Flex and Business can be booked on codeshare flights. Economy Light can only be booked on flights operated by SWISS (airline code LX). For technical reasons, seats cannot be reserved on codeshare flights for the time being.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why doesn't SWISS offer an Economy Flex fare for groups?\n",
      "Group bookings can be changed to any fare option free of charge until the time the ticket is issued provided that the same price is still available. The Economy Flex fare therefore does not provide an additional benefit for groups, and so we do not offer it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can the additional options (advance seat reservation, additional baggage etc.) always be changed?\n",
      "The additional options cannot be rebooked with Economy Light because the fare itself cannot be changed. With the Economy Classic fare, the additional options can only be booked on the same reservation.\n",

      "\n",
      "If I have booked a Light fare and paid for an additional item of baggage and then cancel my flight, do I lose everything?\n",
      "Like the Ecnomy Light fare, the charge for the first item of paid baggage will not be reimbursed, nor can it be used for a different flight.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I book an Economy Classic fare and travel without checked baggage, will I be reimbursed for the baggage not taken?\n",
      "No; no refunds are given for any services included in a fare that are not used.\n",

      "What is the difference between the 1 st bag and the additional bag?\n",

      "Swiss Airlines offers different fare types, each with their own specific cancellation terms and conditions. The most flexible fare types such as Flex and Business Flex allow you to cancel your flight up to 24 hours before departure without any penalty. For other fare types, cancellation fees may apply.\n",
      "If you cancel your Swiss Airlines flight outside of the 24-hour window, cancellation fees will be charged depending on your fare type and the time of cancellation. For example, if you cancel a non-flexible economy class ticket, a cancellation fee will be charged. The closer you cancel to the departure date, the higher the cancellation fee.\n",
